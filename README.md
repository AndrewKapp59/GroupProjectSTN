- Stronger Together Now, a non-profit organization in California from the Inland Empire. STN realized there was no central location for volunteer events and had a goal in mind to connect them all. The purpose of this application is to create a visible platform for volunteers within the Inland Empire Community; where volunteers can save these events or sign up on a 3rd party website to volunteer. 
- <u>Volunteers</u>: This application allows easy access to view and save these event details. 
- <u>Organizations</u>: This application gives organizations an easy way to post their events and edit their profiles which volunteers can view.
- <u>Admins</u>: This applications allow admins to have control over what events are being created and by whom. They have full access to modifying events and can deny events and give feedback.
